## Welcome to my site!

This is a website to showcase my work and projects. I am a self-taught programmer, and I am currently working on a few projects.

In addition to my projects, this portfolio site also contains my blog. I am working on a re-build of my SaaS project, [**Action Backers**](https://actionbackers.com), and I will be documenting my progress on my blog.

When I am not working on Action Backers, or for Strapi as a Solutions Engineer, I love building computers, Hackintosh-ing, Raspberry Pi-ing, and building cool projects with code. I'm always eager to learn more and open to new opportunities.
